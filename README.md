# Markdown Notes App built with React

## Background & Objectives
App that allows to create, change and delete notes. It also presents an editor where the user can toggle between "Write", to write the content of notes with markdown syntax, and "Preview", to see it rendered as HTML. The goal is to work with core features of React, such as useState and useEffect hooks, conditional rendering or local storage.
